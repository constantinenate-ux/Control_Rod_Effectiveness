# Control_Rod_Effectiveness

I simulated the random walks of neutrons in a sample of U-235 undergoing nuclear fission. I then implemented an insertable control rod and measured the effect of different control rod materials on the criticality of the reaction.

## Key Features

- Researched the Neutron Absorptivity of various control rod material candidates.
- Varied both the material type and the percent insertion of the control rod.
- Tracked the criticality of the reaction over time.

## Tools Used

- NumPy's random.uniform and random.exponential
- Parallel and Delayed from joblib
